# LiveLeaderboard
Using the Account Activity, Direct Message, and Post Tweet APIs, this Twitter chatbot listens for incoming scores, ranks them, and Tweets the rankings. This app supports public announcements and private data/vote submissions.

This example was written to keep golf scores, but the underlying patterns are general enough to serve many other use cases.
